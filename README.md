## Set up
To set up the project you need to install all the node modules in both of the projects
```sh
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ cd ../server
$ npm install
```

## Running the projects
For this to work you need to have both the node server and the react project running.
### Start the server
To start the server you need to call these commands
```sh
$ cd server
$ npm run dev
```
This server should now be running on port 5000.

### Start the App
To start the app you need to call 
```sh
$ cd client
$ npm run start
```
This will start the react application on port 3000.
